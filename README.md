I have come up with the following idea to make voting process easier and more secure, reliable, and transparent using Blockchain Technology -
I'll create a webapp "Vote with ease" which will contain details about all the political parties and leaders in India.
The user will first upload the scanned image his Voter ID Card. Using Image and Text Recognition, it will fetch the details of user and reconcile it with data collected from Election Commission of India. If the user's name is on the Voting List, also called Electoral Roll, then the user will be proceeded to the Voting portal. In case if voter does not have Voter ID Card, he can also upload a scanned image of his -
1. Passport
2. Driving License
3. Service Identity Cards with photograph issued to employees by Central/State Govt./PSUs/Public Limited Companies
4. Passbooks with photograph issued by Bank/Post Office
5. PAN Card
6. Smart Card issued by RGI under NPR
7. MNREGA Job Card (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee)
8. Health Insurance Smart Card issued under the scheme of Ministry of Labour
9. Pension document with photograph
10. Official identity cards issued to MPs/MLAs/MLCs
11. Aadhaar Card

After proceeding to Voting Portal, user can cast his vote for the party of his choice. Vote will be recorded as a token and it will be stored permanently using Azure Blockchain so that the same voter does not cast his vote multiple times. Also voter's identity will remain anonymous. Moreover, noone will be able to manipulate the vote as blockchain is a decentralised technology. This will make the online voting process more secure and the user will be able to cast vote from the comfort of his home. Also, because of the comfort and security involved, more people will cast their vote.
